I was jumping rope at our community center. Once I finished, a lady asked if I was a boxer. I said, “I love boxing, but I jump rope for exercise. I’ve never stepped into a ring.”



She mentioned that her dad was a Golden Gloves champion in Flint in the 1950s when “boxing was the most popular sport in the world.” I spontaneously sighed and shook my head at the mention of “boxing,” as if it had disappointed all of us. She saw that as a permission slip and said, “I don’t know what happened.” The way she said it was like a song, and “ha-ap-pened” sounded like it had three syllables. Then she added, “But I still believe!” After that, she became agitated and rattled off all her grievances with the sport, from corruption to performance-enhancing drugs to gambling. Then she said again with optimism, “I still believe.”



In the moment, in the middle of our conversation, I had the idea that those two phrases, “I don’t know what happened” and “I still believe,” could be a melody. This assignment was a chance to try my hand at it. Using the scale run to represent her agitation occurred to me as I was actually frustrated trying to get LilyPond to do what I wanted.



I chose B minor because I borrowed both the tritone (in m. 5) and the minor second for some dissonance before the finish (in m. 19). I thought it would be cool to see the natural symbols there. I am fascinated by Locrian, and I remember Leonard Bernstein saying there is no music using that mode. So, this is a little hint that under this minor facade, Locrian is trying to rip through.
